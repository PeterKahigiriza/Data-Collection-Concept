	\subsection*{INTRODUCTION}This concept is aimed at collecting information about places in Kampala city where most crimes are committed in order to toughen the security at those spots.\\
	
\subsection*{BACKGROUND}Kampala is the capital and largest city of Uganda with a population of over 1.5 million people. The level of crime stands at 66.67 percent while it has been increasing at a rate of 67.50 percent in the past three years.\\

\subsection*{PROBLEM STATEMENT}The crimes include theft,vandalism,assault,armed robbery,physical attack,bribery,etc. \\

\subsection*{RESEARCH AIM}In this concept, I aim to acquire data from people about the places they have visited and have witnessed crime. The data I want to collect includes images and videos possibly of the places and \textit{GPS} coordinates for the location of the place. This data shall be used to compute statistics of crime in those places and this will be helpful in strengthening security in order to curb crime in Kampala.
